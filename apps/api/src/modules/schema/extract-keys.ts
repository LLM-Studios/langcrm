Schema:
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "keys": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "An array of keys representing attributes that describe the user's profile.",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "key": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Specific detailed identifier using dot notation for nested data representation. Does not contain any specific data or context. It is just an identifier that can be used to look up the data in the database."
          },
          "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Detailed information about the keyâ€™s purpose and usage. Describes the abstract type of data stored under this key. Does not contain any specific data or context."
          },
          "value": {
            "type": "any",

        "required": ["key", "description"]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["keys"]
}

Categories broadly cover "personal", "activities", "interests", "preferences" but you can come up with your own if the input does not fit any of these.

Follow these guidelines when generating keys:
1. Do not include information in the key, f.e. "personal.language.german" should instead be "personal.language" because "german" is a value not a key.

Your output has to be a valid JSON object based on the provided schema.
