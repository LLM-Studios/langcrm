The user has provided the following input: "${input}". Based on this input, you need to generate a list of search keys that can be used to identify relevant data in the user's data set. The search keys should be in the format 'key: description'. For example, 'key: activities.recent.skydiving, description: Indicates recent participation in skydiving activity'.`;

The key should describe the abstract type of information that is present in the input, and the description should provide additional context or details about the key. Do not extract any data. Cover all the (hidden) information in the input.

Create a JSON object based on the provided schema. The object describes the identified context keys in the input. We are just designing the schmea, make sure to abstract the information in a way that is useful for the langCRM system in general. Keys should be abstract and not contain any specific data. The description should provide additional context or details about the key. Keys need to be relevant to the input and cover all the information in the input without depending on the specific data or context.
